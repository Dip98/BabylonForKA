# Babylon For KA: Simpler Setup
Sometimes setting up Babylon.js on Khan Academy can be a bit of a hassle, espically when you are new to coding in general. Thats why I made this simple yet effective way to setup Babylon.js with just a few lines of code!

## Setup Instructions
First, create a new HTML webpage on KA. Then make a canvas tag between the body tags like so:
`testing`

```tesing again```
function run(){
            const scene = new BABYLON.Scene(engine);
            //From now on all the code will go here
            return scene;
        }
